# Contact Form Implementation

## Overview

The contact form has been implemented using Resend email service and Supabase Edge Functions. This provides a secure, scalable solution that integrates with the existing email infrastructure.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Frontend Form** (`src/pages/Contact.tsx`)
   - React form with validation
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

2. **Service Layer** (`src/services/contactService.ts`)
   - Handles API calls to Supabase Edge Function
   - Error handling and response processing
   - TypeScript interfaces for type safety

3. **Backend Function** (`supabase/functions/send-contact-form/index.ts`)
   - Supabase Edge Function using Deno
   - Email validation and spam protection
   - Sends emails via Resend API
   - Sends confirmation email to user

### Email Flow

1. User submits contact form
2. Frontend validates form data
3. Service calls Supabase Edge Function
4. Edge Function validates data server-side
5. Sends notification email to support team
6. Sends confirmation email to user
7. Returns success/error response to frontend

## Features

### Security & Validation
- Server-side validation of all form fields
- Email format validation
- CORS handling for cross-origin requests
- Input sanitization

### User Experience
- Loading states during submission
- Clear error messages
- Success confirmation
- Form reset after successful submission
- Disabled form during submission

### Email Templates
- Professional HTML email templates
- Support team notification with contact details
- User confirmation email with message copy
- Branded styling consistent with Family Shapes

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Required for email sending (already configured)

### Email Addresses
- Support team: `hello@familyshapes.com`
- From address: `noreply@familyshapes.com`

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Successful form submission
- Error handling from Supabase
- Network error handling
- Service layer functionality

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test src/test/contact-form.test.tsx
```

## Deployment

The Edge Function is deployed to Supabase and ready to use. The function automatically handles:
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- Input validation
- Email sending via Resend
- Error responses

## Monitoring

The function includes error logging for:
- Resend API errors
- Validation errors
- Network errors
- General exceptions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add rate limiting to prevent spam
2. Store contact submissions in database
3. Add CAPTCHA for additional spam protection
4. Implement email templates with React components
5. Add analytics tracking for form submissions
