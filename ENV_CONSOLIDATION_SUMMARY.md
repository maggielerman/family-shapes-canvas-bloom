# Environment Variable Consolidation Summary

## Overview
Combined and standardized the environment variable configuration for the Family Shapes application. Since only `.env.example` existed (no `env.sample` file was found), the task focused on improving the existing `.env.example` file with comprehensive documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced .env.example File
- **Before**: Basic list of variables with minimal comments
- **After**: Comprehensive, well-organized file with:
  - Clear section headers with emoji icons for visual organization
  - Detailed descriptions for each variable
  - Usage information explaining where each variable is used
  - Security warnings for sensitive keys
  - Developer notes about VITE_ prefix requirements
  - Examples for different environments

### 2. Updated Environment Variables
- Added missing `VITE_` prefixes to client-side Supabase variables
- Added `SUPABASE_USER_ID` for development/testing purposes
- Clarified the distinction between client-side and server-side variables
- Provided clear examples for APP_URL in different environments

### 3. Documentation Updates

#### README.md
- Updated environment setup instructions to reference copying `.env.example`
- Listed all required environment variables with categories
- Added reference to `.env.example` for complete documentation

#### .gitignore
- Added `.env.local` pattern
- Added `.env.*.local` pattern for environment-specific files

## Environment Variables Reference

### Client-Side Variables (VITE_ prefix required)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous/public key

### Server-Side Variables
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Admin key for server operations
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Email service API key
- `APP_URL`: Application URL for absolute links
- `SUPABASE_USER_ID`: Optional test user ID for seeding

## Developer Guidelines
1. Always copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for local development
2. Never commit `.env.local` or any file with real credentials
3. Client-side variables must have `VITE_` prefix
4. Server-side variables should NOT have `VITE_` prefix
5. Update `.env.example` when adding new environment variables

## Files Modified
- `/workspace/.env.example` - Complete rewrite with comprehensive documentation
- `/workspace/README.md` - Updated environment setup section
- `/workspace/.gitignore` - Added `.env.local` patterns

## No Additional Changes Needed
- `documentation/CONTACT_FORM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` already correctly references environment variables
- No `env.sample` file was found to merge
- The Supabase client file is auto-generated and uses hardcoded values
