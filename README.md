## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account for database and authentication

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd family-shapes-canvas-bloom

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Supabase URL and anon key to .env.local

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

For local DB tooling (Makefile/scripts), also create a root-level `.env` (not committed):

```env
SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=nhkufibfwskdpzdjwirr
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your-remote-db-password
```

### Database Migrations

This repo uses **Supabase migrations as the source of truth**. Do not edit production in the Dashboard.

**Common tasks**

```bash
make            # list all DB targets
make db/status  # local stack status
make db/reset   # rebuild local from migrations (+ seed.sql if present)
make db/diff name=0002_short_description  # create a new migration
make db/types   # regenerate TS types
make db/check   # ensure no drift vs PROD
make db/push    # apply migrations to PROD (after PR merge/CI green)
```

> Baseline migration already exists: `supabase/migrations/20250806171912_0001_baseline_prod_schema.sql`. New work starts at `0002_*`.

# Agent Instructions: Supabase Migrations & Drift Policy

This repository treats **SQL migrations in `supabase/migrations/` as the single source of truth** for the database schema. Agents (Cursor, etc.) and humans must follow this process. **Do not modify production via the Supabase Dashboard** except when explicitly instructed for emergencies.

## Environment assumptions

- Local `.env` exists at repo root and is **not committed**. Minimum keys:
  ```env
  SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=nhkufibfwskdpzdjwirr
  SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your-remote-db-password
  # Optional: SUPABASE_CI=1
  ```
- Supabase CLI is installed and the project is linked: `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` (the scripts auto-link if needed).

## Allowed commands (run from repo root)

- **Create a migration** from changes vs PROD:
  ```bash
  make db/diff name=0002_short_description
  ```
- **Verify** the repo can rebuild from migrations (idempotent):
  ```bash
  make db/reset
  make db/check   # must print: ‚úÖ No drift.
  ```
- **Regenerate API types** (for TypeScript):
  ```bash
  make db/types
  ```
- **Apply to production** (only after PR review / CI green):
  ```bash
  make db/push
  ```

## Prohibited

- Editing production schema directly in the Supabase Dashboard.
- Modifying or deleting the baseline migration: `*_0001_baseline_prod_schema.sql`.
- Writing migrations outside `supabase/migrations/`.
- Committing `.env` or any secrets.

## File conventions

- CLI creates timestamped files: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_name.sql`.
- Dev/test data belongs in `supabase/seed.sql` (optional, idempotent), not inside schema migrations.
- Pre-baseline files are kept in `supabase/_archived_migrations/`; do **not** move them back into the loader path.

## Pull Request checklist (agents)

- [ ] Migration added under `supabase/migrations/` with a clear name.
- [ ] Local rebuild OK: `make db/reset`.
- [ ] Drift check OK: `make db/check` ‚Üí prints **No drift**.
- [ ] Types updated if needed: `make db/types`.
- [ ] PR description summarizes schema/RLS/trigger impacts and any rollout notes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Drift check hangs or prompts**: ensure `.env` has `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` and `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` with no quotes; re-run `make db/check`.
- **Local Postgres crash-loops after CLI update**: clear local Docker volumes and restart:
  ```bash
  supabase stop
  docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q --filter label=com.supabase.cli.project=nhkufibfwskdpzdjwirr)
  supabase start
  ```
- **Pre‚Äëpush hook blocks push**: one-off bypass with `git push --no-verify`, then investigate with `make db/check`.
